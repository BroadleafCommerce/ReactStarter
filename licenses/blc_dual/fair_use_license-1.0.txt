        BROADLEAF BELIEVES AN ACTION POSSIBLE, BROADLEAF RETAINS THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT AND TAKE
        POSSESSION OF THE COMMUNITY SOFTWARE. THIS SECTION STATES BROADLEAF'S ENTIRE LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO ALLEGED

        unauthorized use and provide software deployment verification and other information regarding the limitations
        above. In the event that Broadleaf requests a report for confirmation, you will provide a system generated report
        verifying your software deployment.

    sooner terminated by Broadleaf for convenience by giving you ten (10) days' written notice, whichever occurs first.

    Evaluation Loaned and Beta Software and freeware free of charge, but, in the case of Evaluation Software, solely for
    the purpose of evaluation and not in a production environment. If you are found to be using the Evaluation, Loaned,
    or Beta Software beyond the terms contained in this Section you shall immediately pay Broadleaf a license Fee for
    such software and all terms under this Agreement will be binding. Unless otherwise specifically agreed in writing by
    Broadleaf, Broadleaf does not provide maintenance or support for any Evaluation Software, Loaned Software or Beta
    Software. YOU RECOGNIZE THAT THE EVALUATION, LOANED OR BETA SOFTWARE MAY HAVE DEFECTS OR DEFICIENCIES WHICH CANNOT

    Loaned Software or Beta Software infringes any patent, copyright, trade secret or other intellectual property right.
    In the event of such an action, Broadleaf retains the right to terminate this Agreement and take possession of the
    Evaluation, Loaned or Beta Software. THIS SECTION STATES Broadleaf'S ENTIRE LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO ALLEGED
    INFRINGEMENTS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS BY EVALUATION SOFTWARE, LOANED SOFTWARE OR BETA SOFTWARE ANY

    provided that (a) the Managing Party only Uses the Software for your internal operations and not for the benefit of
    another third party; (b) the Managing Party agrees to comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and
    (c) you provide Broadleaf with written notice that a Managing Party will be Using the Software on your behalf.

    service bureau or other arrangement. You may not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Software, except

9.  Warranty and Disclaimer.
    a.  Limited Warranty. Broadleaf warrants that for sixty (60) days from the date of original purchase the media, if any,
        on which the Software is contained and provided to you will be free from defects in materials and workmanship.
    b.  End User Remedies. Broadleaf's and its suppliers' entire liability and your exclusive remedy for any breach of
        the foregoing warranty shall be, at Broadleaf's option, either (i) return of the purchase price you paid for the
        license, or (ii) replacement of the defective media in which the Software is contained. You must return the
        defective media to Broadleaf at your expense with a copy of your receipt. This limited warranty is void if the
        defect has resulted from accident, abuse, or misapplication. Any replacement media will be warranted for the
        remainder of the original warranty period. Outside the United States, this remedy is not available to the extent
        Broadleaf is subject to restrictions under United States export control laws and regulations.
    c.  Warranty Disclaimer. Except for the limited warranty set forth herein, THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND
        Broadleaf MAKES NO WARRANTY AS TO ITS USE OR PERFORMANCE. EXCEPT FOR ANY WARRANTY, CONDITION, REPRESENTATION OR
        TERM THE EXTENT TO WHICH CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED BY APPLICABLE LAW. Broadleaf, ITS SUPPLIERS AND AUTHORIZED
        PATNERS MAKE NO WARRANTY, CONDITION, REPRESENTATION, OR TERM (EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WHETHER BY STATUTE, COMMON LAW,
        CUSTOM, USAGE OR OTHERWISE) AS TO ANY MATTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS,
        MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, INTEGRATION, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. YOU ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY
        FOR SELECTING THE SOFTWARE TO ACHIEVE YOUR INTENDED RESULTS, AND FOR THE INSTALLATION OF, USE OF, AND RESULTS
        OBTAINED FROM THE SOFTWARE. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING PROVISIONS, Broadleaf MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT THE
        SOFTWARE WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR FREE FROM INTERRUPTIONS OR OTHER FAILURES OR THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET YOUR
        REQUIREMENTS.

10. Limitation of Liability. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER IN TORT, CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE,
    SHALL Broadleaf OR ITS AUTHORIZED PARTNERS OR SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY OTHER PERSON FOR LOSS OF PROFITS,
    LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOSS OF DATA, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR DAMAGES FOR GROSS
    NEGLIGENCE OF ANY Form INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, APPLIANCE FAILURE
    OR MALFUNCTION, OR FOR ANY OTHER DAMAGE OR LOSS. IN NO EVENT SHALL Broadleaf OR ITS AUTHORIZED PARTNERS OR SUPPLIERS
    BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGE IN EXCESS OF THE PRICE PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE, IF ANY, EVEN IF Broadleaf OR ITS AUTHORIZED
    PARTNERS OR SUPPLIERS SHALL HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. This limitation shall not apply
    to liability for death or personal injury to the extent that applicable law prohibits such limitation. Furthermore,
    some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this
    limitation and exclusion may not apply to you. Nothing contained in this Agreement limits Broadleaf's liability to
    you for Broadleaf's negligence or for the tort of fraud. Broadleaf is acting on behalf of its suppliers and Authorized
    Partners for the purpose of disclaiming, excluding and/or limiting obligations, warranties and liability as provided
    in this Agreement, but in no other respects and for no other purpose. The foregoing provisions shall be enforceable
    to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.
