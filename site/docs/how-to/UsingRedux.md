# Using Redux

Redux is an integral part of our application and is the primary mechanism for
managing state. There are many facets of using redux in our application, we will
cover some of them right now. The best introduction to Redux
would be the [official Redux documentation](http://redux.js.org/) or
[Dan Abramov's video tutorial on egghead](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux).
I highly recommend doing some tutorials on redux before consulting this document.
