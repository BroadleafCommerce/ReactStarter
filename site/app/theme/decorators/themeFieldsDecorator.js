/**
 * This decorator is used to inject theme fields into a component. This handles
 * the fetching and caching of the theme fields in the redux state, as well as
 * selecting those theme fields from the redux state.
 *
 * This can be used by wrapping a component like so:
 *
 * export default ThemeFields('logoImage')(HeaderLogo);
 *
 * HeaderLogo will now have a prop named `logoImage` that it can use.
 *
 * @param {Array} fieldNames the field names to inject
